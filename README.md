# wavecx-react-native
Add WaveCX to your React Native application.

## Installation
`npm install wavecx-react-native`

## Quickstart
```tsx
import * as React from 'react';
import { useEffect } from 'react';
import { Button } from 'react-native';
import { HmacSHA256 } from 'crypto-js';

import { WaveCxProvider, useWaveCx } from 'wavecx-react-native';

export const App = () => (
  <WaveCxProvider organizationCode={'your-org-code'}>
    <Main />
  </WaveCxProvider>
);

const Main = () => {
  const { handleEvent } = useWaveCx();

  useEffect(() => {
    handleEvent({
      type: 'session-started',
      userId: 'user-id',
      userIdVerification: createUserIdVerification('user-id'),
    });
  }, []);

  return (
    <Button
      title={'Trigger Point'}
      onPress={() => {
        handleEvent({
          type: 'trigger-point',
          triggerPoint: 'trigger-point-code',
        });
      }}
    />
  );
};

// WARNING: User ID verification should NOT be performed on client.
// This is here only for brevity of example.
const createUserIdVerification = (userId: string) =>
  HmacSHA256(userId, 'your-signing-secret').toString()
```

## Usage
WaveCX follows an event-driven architecture, only needing events
raised as they occur within your application.

### Session Started Events
Because WaveCX content is targeted and tracked per user,
a "session started" event is required upon user authentication.

```ts
handleEvent({
  type: 'session-started',
  userId: 'user-id',
  userIdVerification: createUserIdVerification('user-id'),
});
```

#### User ID Verification
The user ID verification parameter is an HMACSHA256 hash of the
provided user ID, signed with a signing secret specific to your
organization. This is used to prevent user ID spoofing and
ensure that requests to WaveCX are from authorized sources.

The signing secret should be stored only in a protected environment
(i.e. a backend service) which your client application can
communicate with in order to retrieve ID verification hashes.

**Never send or store the signing secret to the client application.**

### Trigger Point Events

```ts
handleEvent({
  type: 'trigger-point',
  triggerPoint: 'trigger-point-code',
});
```

A trigger point is an event within your application
that content can be attached to.

When a trigger-point event is raised, WaveCX will check for and
present any content set for that trigger point that is relevant
for the current user.

### Session Ended Events
If trigger points may still be reached in your application
after the user is no longer authenticated, a session ended
event must be raised to notify WaveCX that trigger points
should no longer be handled for a previously identified user.

```ts
handleEvent({ type: 'session-ended' });
```
